# Results 
We have given an implementation of the Bentley-Ottmann plane sweep algorithm for line segment intersection. The implementation is complete and reliable in the sense that it will work for all input instances.
This algorithm is asymptotically more efficient than a naive approach (time complexity : O(n^2)) as this algorithm has asymptotic time complexity of O(nLogn).
we tested our algorithm by generating n (1 < n < 10000) segments with random coordinates between -100000 to 100000 to test the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm.
